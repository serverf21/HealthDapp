# Healthcare DApp 

The potential of blockchain technology in healthcare is significant as it has the ability to connect disparate systems and generate valuable insights, ultimately leading to better patient care. An integrated blockchain network for electronic medical records can improve efficiency and facilitate better health outcomes in the long term.

Here are some elaborations on the features, technology stack, limitations and future aspects of the proposed healthcare DApp:

Features:

1. The proposed healthcare DApp has four entities sign up options: patients, doctors, insurance companies and chemists.
2. Each patient's complete medical data is linked to their unique Aadhar Card number, creating a secure method of protecting patient identity.
3. Patient data like previous medical reports, information on major diseases and allergies will be stored on private and public blockchains using cryptography to ensure security.
4. Smart contracts will enable a consistent and rule-based method of accessing patient data, which can be permissioned to selected health organizations.
5. Insurance companies can define their acceptance conditions and the points not covered by the company based on the patient data available, which determines whether or not the insurance will be accepted or rejected.

Technology Stack:

1. Solidity will be used to build the blockchain network.
2. Truffle will be used to migrate contracts onto the host.
3. ReactJS will be used to build the front-end.
4. Web3 will connect Solidity to the user interface.
5. MetaMask will allow users to run the Ethereum DApp in the browser.

Limitations:

1. Access rights to user data need to be granted by an authority to ensure privacy and security.

Future Aspects:

1. To store larger data files, off-chain data storage on cloud servers using encryption will be used, and the key will be stored in the blockchain.
2. Governments of various countries can use this DApp to create a direct passage between the true beneficiaries and government, resulting in better utilization of resources.
